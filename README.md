# Project Falcon

## Overview

Project Falcon is a cutting-edge autonomous drone platform that combines computer vision, machine learning, and advanced navigation systems to create a self-operating UAV capable of intelligent object detection and autonomous flight.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Object Detection**: Utilizes deep learning models to identify and track objects in real-time.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Integrates GPS, IMU, and sensor fusion for obstacle avoidance and path planning.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Employs edge computing for low-latency decision-making.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves flight efficiency and detection accuracy through machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, ROS (Robot Operating System)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectFalcon.git
   cd ProjectFalcon
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
